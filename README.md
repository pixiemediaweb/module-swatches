# module-swatches
If you are having issues with text swatch labels in Magento 2.2.4, you are not alone.  

An error in that release means the admin swatch value is shown instead of the store value.

Replace the /vendor/magento/module-swatches folder with this version from Magento 2.2.3 as a quick solution to resolve the issue.  There is no module version difference, so no need to worry about setup:upgrade/downgrade.

Hopefully an official patch will be released soon, but until then, this will help.
